Centennial Struggles is an online platform dedicated to documenting and visualizing the impact of the carceral power in Colorado’s Front Range. Our mission is to provide activists, scholars, and community members with the tools and resources needed to understand and challenge the expansion of carceral power in our region.

By combining interactive maps with a community-driven archive, Centennial Struggles seeks to uncover the connections between government institutions, private corporations, and the communities affected by the prison industrial complex in Colorado. By combining historical research with crowdsourced contributions, we aim to shed light on the struggles against incarceration and policing in Colorado.
